cssgrep
=======

## Usage

```
cssgrep.rb <selector> [FILE...]
xpathgrep.rb <selector> [FILE...]
```

They search the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, or
if a single hyphen-minus (-) is given as file name) for tags matching the CSS
or XPath selector and prints them.

Use `cssgrep.rb` with a CSS selector, or `xpathgrep.rb` if you prefer XPath
selectors.

Both are Ruby scripts using [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/).
See http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html to install it.
